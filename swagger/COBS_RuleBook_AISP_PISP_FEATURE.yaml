        - Part of the response is also the set of scenarios that may contain one
        or more authorisation scenarios. If more scenarios are returned, it is
        up to the client to select what scenario to choose. The power of
        verifying each scenario should correspond to the power of other
        scenarios, or the scenarios are mutually replaceable.

        - Each scenario is defined as the sequence of codes of particular
        authorization methods.

        - Each bank may define and describe in its documentation its own
        authorization scenarios.

        - CODE of authorization methods of these scenarios is used in the

        Step II. Standing Order authorization initiation - specific for each
        bank
      description: >
        - This resource is designed to **start a specific authorization method**
        from the selected scenario.

        - The input is the JSON object containing the required type of
        authorization method - **CODE** and all elements specific for that step.

        - The output of this resource is an overview of values required for
        completing the authorization.

        - **E.g., for CODE corresponding to the federated authorization, the
        response will be URL and parameters for redirecting to the federated
        authorization page.**

        - And, for instance, for CODE corresponding to authorization through the
        OTP code sent by SMS, the response will only be the confirmation of
        sending the code. The sending as such is initiated by the bank.


        **Resource characteristics:**
          * **Authorization:**  request requires the authorization of user/client as part of API calling
          * **Use certificate:**  request requires the use of the qualified third-party certificate
          * **Paging:** no
          * **Sorting:**  no
          * **Filtering:**  no

        - An optional resource designed for the finalization of the
        authorization process. 

        - The resource may be purely indicative or returns information on
        whether the authorization process was completed and with what result. 

        - E.g., in the case of federated authorization.

        - Or what input, e.g. for entering the received OTP for the SMS method.

        - Then the output is information on the authorization and also OTP
        verification.


        **Resource characteristics:**
          * **Authorization:**  request requires the authorization of user/client as part of the API calling
          * **Use certificate:**  request requires the use of the third-party qualified certificate
          * **Paging:** no
          * **Sorting:**  no

      summary: Generating Authorization ID.
      description: >
        - Generating the authorization ID for payment before the initiation of
        the authorization process. The resource is implemented by banks that do
        not want to generate authorization ID for payment in the response when
        entering a new (unauthorized) payment through the resource POST
        /my/payments.

        - Each bank may define and describe in its documentation its own
        authorization scenarios. The CODE of authorization methods for these
        scenarios is used in the response of this resource.

        - Part of the response is also the set of scenarios that may contain one
        or more authorisation scenarios. If more scenarios are returned, it is
        up to the client to select what scenario to choose. The power of
        verifying each scenario should correspond to the power of other
        scenarios, or the scenarios are mutually replaceable.

        - Each scenario is defined as the sequence of codes of particular
        authorization methods. The code of authorization method is defined by
        the bank and should be described in its own API documentation outside
        the ČOBS standard.



        **Resource characteristics:**
          * **Authorization:**  request requires the authorization of user/client as part of API calling
          * **Use certificate:**  request requires the use of the qualified third-party certificate

      summary: Step II. Payment authorization initiation - specific for each bank
      description: >
        - This resource is designed to **start a specific authorization method**
        from the selected scenario.

        - The input is the JSON object containing the required type of
        authorization method - **CODE** and all elements specific for that step.

        - The output of this resource is an overview of values required for
        completing the authorization.

        - **E.g., for CODE corresponding to the federated authorization, the
        response will be URL and parameters for redirecting to the federated
        authorization page.**

        - And, for instance, for CODE corresponding to authorization through the
        OTP code sent by SMS, the response will only be the confirmation of
        sending the code. The sending as such is initiated by the bank.


        **Resource characteristics:**
          * **Authorization:**  request requires the authorization of user/client as part of API calling
          * **Use certificate:**  request requires the use of the qualified third-party certificate
          * **Paging:** no
          * **Sorting:**  no
          * **Filtering:**  no

        - Part of the response is also the set of scenarios that may contain one
        or more authorisation scenarios. If more scenarios are returned, it is
        up to the client to select what scenario to choose. The power of
        verifying each scenario should correspond to the power of other
        scenarios, or the scenarios are mutually replaceable.

        - Each scenario is defined as the sequence of codes of particular
        authorization methods.

        - Each bank may define and describe in its documentation its own
        authorization scenarios.

        - CODE of authorization methods of these scenarios is used in the
        response of this resource.

        - The output of this resource is an overview of values required for
        completing the authorization.

        - **E.g., for CODE corresponding to the federated authorization, the
        response will be URL and parameters for redirecting to the federated
        authorization page.**

        - And, for instance, for CODE corresponding to authorization through the
        OTP code sent by SMS, the response will only be the confirmation of
        sending the code. The sending as such is initiated by the bank.

      description: >
        - An optional resource designed for the finalization of the
        authorization process. 

        - The resource may be purely indicative or returns information on
        whether the authorization process was completed and with what result. 

        - E.g., in the case of federated authorization.

        - Or what input, e.g. for entering the received OTP for the SMS method.

        - Then the output is information on the authorization and also OTP
        verification.


        **Resource characteristics:**
          * **Authorization:**  request requires the authorization of user/client as part of the API calling
          * **Use certificate:**  request requires the use of the third-party qualified certificate
          * **Paging:** no
          * **Sorting:**  no
          * **Filtering:**  no
