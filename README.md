# Czech Standard for Open Banking issue tracker
On 16 November 2015, the European Banking Authority issued the Revised Payment Service Directive (hereinafter: PSD2), which, among other things, opens banking for the so-called third parties. In order to maintain equal competition between all stakeholders, the EBA seeks to maintain neutrality and defines basic rules of functioning in PSD2 at a general level. The EBA will provide more detailed requirements for stakeholders in the so-called Regulatory Technical Standards and EBA Guidelines. Despite the specification of open banking rules to third parties, the implementation across particular banks may vary. This versatility implies a more complex, and more expensive integration of third parties to become payment service providers keeping accounts. In order to support the European PSD2 regulation and its proper implementation, the banks in the Czech market have decided to standardize their solutions.

The aim of the Czech Standard for Open Banking is to lay down rules for communication, mainly for services defined by the Revised Payment Service Directive-Account Information Service Provider (AISP), Payment Initiation Service Provider (PISP), Card Issuing Service Provider (PISP)

The standard is designed and developed to maintain a high degree of versatility. The standard is voluntary, and it is up to each bank to consider joining the standard. With respect to that systems and their operations are different across payment service providers, standard participants may deviate from the standard at certain points, within the scope of their information systems. Since each payment service provider is obliged to document its solution according to PSD2, a large number of fields for optional information is defined in the Czech Open Banking Standard.

The main benefits of the Czech Standard are the easier integration of TPP at banks, including without any other intermediaries, ensuring a uniform interpretation of the Directive in the Czech market, compliance with the content of the transmitted data and security elements in communication with banks, support for the unified functioning of services for clients across banks, timely readiness for the implementation of PSD2.
